# <u>**HBM Nuclear Tech Mod - 1.12.2 Extended Edition**</u>
This is my 1.12.2 custom version of the mod

which is forked from the fork made by [TheOriginalGolem](https://github.com/TheOriginalGolem/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT)
which is forked from the port made by [Drillgon200](https://github.com/Drillgon200/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT)
which is ported from the original mod made by [HBMTheBobcat](https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT).

This fork was made to fucos on improving parts of the RBMK reactors, so far there has been added:
Freezer indicators, will light up if an emergency freezer is triggered
Boiler and heater indicators, dark blue at empty, blue at full, and red if full of hot coolant or steam
Low temperature freezer, same as the emergency freezer but set to trigger at default 500C (soon can be adjusted)
Overheat indicators, the column icon slowly turns red as it normally does but past 1200C (soon to be adjustable to your needs) will go bright yellow to tell you its AZ-5 time
to be done:
industrial condenser, same as a steam condenser, but has half of the cooling power of a auxiliary tower and uses power
make it possible to change RBMK parts configs thru the console
AZ-5 can overwrite the automatic rods (can manual control) and there will be a button to undo the overwrite(makes them go back to automatic control)

The latest version can be found on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hbms-nuclear-tech-mod-extended-edition) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/ntm-extended) or under the [Releases page](https://github.com/Alcatergit/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT/releases).
